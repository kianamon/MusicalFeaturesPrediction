    "Welcome to your term project! This is the first portion of a two-part, open-ended team assignment. It will culminate in a presentation during the last week of class or the regularly scheduled final exam period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this term project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with exploring datasets for possible associations, relationships, and predictive capacities. This will then be followed up with the execution more complex and intensive analysis that prototypes the function of a potential application or underpin an empirical finding. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A topically-motivated exploration of available pre-processed datasets, i.e., exploratory data analyses. \n",
    "2. Interpreting the outcome of phase (1), the selection and execution of a more in depth analytics project, prototyping an application's function or empirical investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first report on your team's project will summarize any visual and quantitative exploratory findings from (1) and outline and motivate a course for (2). So this first phase should include both a discussion of the __availability and scale of the project's target data__ and an exploratory analysis and discussion of __why it may be possible to conduct the target analysis__, including any relevant pre-built technologies and tools that will make it possible, and how. Additionally, this inital project planning report should speculate and provide examples for potential analytic outcomes and how we might interpret and build from them, whether towards academic or commercial outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: All reports should inclue a high level abstract/discussion in a tone that is set for a completely diverse audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the term, your group will provide a final report that recaps progress at the task you're group has come up with, specifically revisiting what you _thought_ the results of the in depth analysis would be, as compared to the actual work involved, obstacles encountered, and results obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Important__: because your project reports will have discussion intermingled with data and code as output, I not only request the  submission of your work in Jupyter Notebooks format, but additionly recommend conducting your work as a group collaboratively in Jupyter notebooks."
